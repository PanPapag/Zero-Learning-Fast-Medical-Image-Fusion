# Zero-Learning-Fast-Medical-Image-Fusion

A Python3 implementation of the paper https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/270048 using PyTorch and OpenCV.

## Image fusion 
In clinical applications, such as image-guided surgery and noninvasive diagnosis, medical image fusion plays a central role by integrating information from multiple sources into a single, more understandable output. An example generated by the method proposed is illustrated below:
